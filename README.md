# Wireframing

## What Is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a website, app, or digital product before the actual design or development begins. It focuses on the layout, structure, and functionality — not the final colors or graphics.  
Think of it as the skeleton of your design that helps visualize where key elements like buttons, images, and text will go.

## Why Wireframing Is Important
Wireframing plays a critical role in the design process because it:
- **Clarifies the structure:** It helps designers and developers agree on the basic layout before any detailed design work starts.  
- **Saves time and resources:** Changes are easier (and cheaper) to make at the wireframe stage than later in development.  
- **Improves user experience (UX):** Wireframes focus on usability, ensuring that navigation and content flow make sense to users.  
- **Encourages collaboration:** Teams and stakeholders can discuss and refine the layout early on, avoiding confusion later.

## Types of Wireframes
1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Simple sketches or grayscale boxes that show layout and content placement.  
2. **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes:** Include more detail and refined spacing to represent a closer structure to the final product.  
3. **High-Fidelity Wireframes:** Digitally created with realistic spacing, typography, and sometimes basic interactivity.

## Tools Commonly Used for Wireframing
- Figma  
- Adobe XD  
- Sketch   
- Miro

> ✨ **Take home:** Wireframing bridges the gap between an idea and a functional design, ensuring a clear, user-focused structure before the visuals come to life.
