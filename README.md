# Wireframing

## What Is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a website, app, or digital product before the actual design or development begins. It focuses on the layout, structure, and functionality — not the final colors or graphics.  
Think of it as the skeleton of your design that helps visualize where key elements like buttons, images, and text will go.

## Why Wireframing Is Important
Wireframing plays a critical role in the design process because it:
- **Clarifies the structure:** It helps designers and developers agree on the basic layout before any detailed design work starts.  
- **Saves time and resources:** Changes are easier (and cheaper) to make at the wireframe stage than later in development.  
- **Improves user experience (UX):** Wireframes focus on usability, ensuring that navigation and content flow make sense to users.  
- **Encourages collaboration:** Teams and stakeholders can discuss and refine the layout early on, avoiding confusion later.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are built around several core elements that define the structure and functionality of a digital interface.

### 1. **Layout Structure**
The layout defines the overall organization of the page — how sections like headers, sidebars, and footers are arranged.  
**Example:** Placing a navigation bar at the top ensures users can easily access other pages without scrolling.

### 2. **Navigation**
Navigation shows how users move through the site or app. This includes menus, links, buttons, and breadcrumbs.  
**Example:** A sidebar with icons and labels helps users understand where they are and where they can go next, improving usability.

### 3. **Content Placement**
This focuses on where text, images, videos, and forms are positioned within the layout.  
**Example:** Putting a “Sign Up” form above the fold (visible without scrolling) increases user engagement and conversion rates.

### 4. **Functionality**
Functionality elements represent interactive components like buttons, sliders, or search bars — often shown as boxes or icons in wireframes.  
**Example:** A “Submit” button in a contact form shows where user interaction will occur and guides design discussions on how it should behave.

## 🧱 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes vary in **fidelity** — meaning the level of detail and realism they include.  
Here are the main types:

### 🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Quickly sketch ideas and test layout concepts before detailed design begins.  
- **Appearance:** Basic shapes, grayscale colors, and placeholder text (e.g., “Lorem Ipsum”).  
- **Tools Used:** Pen & paper, Balsamiq, or whiteboard sketches.  
- **When Used:** In the early stages of design to brainstorm and discuss general structure.  
- **Example Use Case:** Early homepage mockups showing where the header, hero image, and navigation might go — without worrying about visuals or typography.

### 🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Present a more polished and realistic version of the design, often including real text, images, and spacing.  
- **Appearance:** Detailed layouts with accurate typography, colors, and sometimes interactivity.  
- **Tools Used:** Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.  
- **When Used:** In later stages of design, just before or during prototyping and development handoff.  
- **Example Use Case:** A clickable app or website mockup used to gather final feedback from stakeholders.

### Type: **High-Fidelity Wireframe**

### Description
The attached link shows a **high-fidelity wireframe** created in Figma. It includes:

- **Detailed page layouts** for multiple screens (Home/Listing Page, Detail Page, and Checkout).  
- **Real images, typography, and spacing**, making it visually close to a final UI.  
- **Functional flow representation** — users can visually trace how one page connects to the next.  
- **Organized design boards** labeled by page type, typical of advanced prototyping.

### When Used
This type of wireframe is typically used **toward the end of the design phase**, to:
- Demonstrate visual hierarchy and usability.
- Prepare for stakeholder review or developer handoff.
- Create interactive prototypes for usability testing.

> ✨ **Take home:** Wireframing bridges the gap between an idea and a functional design, ensuring a clear, user-focused structure before the visuals come to life.
